Folder structure & other files
============================
> e2e                   for end-to-end testing. We won't use it.
> node_modules          contains the project's dependencies
> src                   contains most of our code
    > app               includes the routing, components, and more
    > assets
    > environments
    ..index.html        entry point to the app, and you generally don't touch this file.
    ..styles.scss       where your global CSS rulesets will reside
  

Angular CLI commands
============================
ng serve
    Runs the project. Default port is 4200
ng serve -o
    (open) It also opens the browser with that location
ng generate component home || ng g c home
    generates the home component
ng generate service http || ng g s http
    generates the http service
ng build --prod
    creates a dist folder with the production build.
    We can then install lite-server and use it to open it in our browser (or use another web server)

Router
============================
routerLink
    Ex: <a href="#" routerLink="/list">Breweries</a>
    This is how you link together different pages of your app. You don't use href.
router-outlet
    Ex: <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    This is where routed components are displayed within the template. 

# Generate components (home & list)
ng g c home
ng g c list

ngIf (from angular.io)
============================
Simple form with shorthand syntax:
    <div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>

Simple form with expanded syntax:
    <ng-template [ngIf]="condition">
        <div>Content to render when condition is true.</div>
    </ng-template>

Else block with shorthand syntax:
    <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
    <ng-template #elseBlock>
        Content to render when condition is false.
    </ng-template>

Then and Else block with shorthand syntax:
    <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
    <ng-template #thenBlock>
        Content to render when condition is true.
    </ng-template>
    <ng-template #elseBlock>
        Content to render when condition is false.
