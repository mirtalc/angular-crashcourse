    ..index.html        entry point to the app, and you generally don't touch this file.
    ..styles.scss       where your global CSS rulesets will reside
  

Angular CLI commands
============================
ng serve
    Runs the project. Default port is 4200
ng serve -o
    (open) It also opens the browser with that location


Router
============================
routerLink
    Ex: <a href="#" routerLink="/list">Breweries</a>
    This is how you link together different pages of your app. You don't use href.
router-outlet
    Ex: <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    This is where routed components are displayed within the template.
